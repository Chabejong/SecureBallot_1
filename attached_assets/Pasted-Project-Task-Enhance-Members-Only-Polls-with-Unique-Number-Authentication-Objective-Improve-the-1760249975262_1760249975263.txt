Project Task: Enhance Members-Only Polls with Unique Number Authentication

Objective: Improve the integrity of "Members Only" polls by implementing a system where each vote is authenticated using a unique, non-reusable number from a pre-defined range. This will prevent duplicate voting and ensure that only authorized members can vote.

1. Core Requirements
A. New Fields for Members-Only Polls
When a user creates a new poll or edits an existing one and marks it as "Members Only," two new required fields must become visible and mandatory:
Authentication Number Start (Integer): The beginning of the valid number range (e.g., 1).
Authentication Number End (Integer): The end of the valid number range (e.g., 100).
Validation: End must be greater than Start. The total number of available codes will be (End - Start + 1).

B. The Authentication Number Pool
Upon saving a Members-Only poll, the system must generate a pool of all unique numbers within the specified range (e.g., for 1-100, it generates numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., 100).
This pool is specific to that single poll.
These numbers represent the valid "authentication codes" for voting.

C. The Voting Process for Members
On the poll page for a Members-Only poll, a new input field labeled "Authentication Number" or "Vote Code" must be displayed to logged-in members.
The member must enter one of the numbers from the pre-defined range.
When the vote is submitted, the system must perform the following checks:
The provided number is an integer within the Start and End range for this poll.
The provided number has not already been used in a previous vote for this same poll.
If Valid:
The vote is recorded.
The used authentication number is marked as consumed in the pool and cannot be used again for this poll.
The user sees a success message.
If Invalid (number out of range, not an integer, or already used):
The vote is rejected.
The user sees a clear error message (e.g., "Invalid or already used authentication number.").

D. Secrecy of Authentication Numbers in Results
The results page and any data exports for the poll must never display which authentication number was used for which vote.
The authentication number is solely for validation and must be kept private from the general audience and other voters.

For Administrators:
Easy Setup: Check "Members Only" to enable number authentication
Participation Reports: See which numbers have/haven't voted
